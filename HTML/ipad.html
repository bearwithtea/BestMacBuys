            The iPad is probably Steve Job's second most famous reveal, falling second only to the iPhone. Desgined to be a tablet for creatives and makers, the iPad permeated into the zeitgeist and is now widely used by schools, corporations, and anyone who wants their kid to be silent on a plane ride. This means that, like the rest of Apple's lineup, there's one for everyone!

                <div id="airdescription">
                    If you're considering the iPad Pro, take a look at the <b> 13-Inch Model </b> for the extra screen real estate. The <b> 1 TB </b> of storage will be plenty for all of your files and photos. The decision between the <b> Standard glass </b> and <b> Nano-texture glass </b> is a bit more personal, but I recommend the <b> Nano-texture </b> for people in brighter work environments. If you plan to be on the go, I would recommend <b> Wi-Fi + Cellular </b> and pair that with the <b> Apple Pencil Pro</b> along with the <b> Apple Magic Keyboard </b> to essentially turn this into a MacBook.

                The MacBook Pro is for power users on the go. The model to look out for is the <b>16-inch, 14-Core GPU, M3 Pro</b>. Target <b>48GB of RAM</b> for your larger projects. Pair that with the <b>1TB of storage</b> and you will be ready for anything your work throws at you. If you're someone who needs specialized software, such as Final Cut Pro, considering picking it up at the end of the checkout process.

                Apple's all in one solution is the iMac, and it is meant for offices or home offices where people don't need a machine on the go. Choose the <b>10-Core GPU</b> for the added Ethernet and opt for <b>16GB of RAM</b> and <b>512GB of storage</b>. If you are sans a keyboard and mouse, make sure to consider the matching Magic Keyboard and Mouse at the end of the checkout.

                The Mac Studio is the big brother of the Mac mini. Desgined to be the desktop version of the MacBook Pro, this is more of a workhorse. Pick the <b>60-Core GPU</b> with <b>128GB of RAM</b> paired with the <b>2TB of storage</b>. It's pricey, but this machine will chew threw everything you throw at it without hesitation.
