            The iPad is probably Steve Job's second most famous reveal, falling second only to the iPhone. Desgined to be a tablet for creatives and makers, the iPad permeated into the zeitgeist and is now widely used by schools, corporations, and anyone who wants their kid to be silent on a plane ride. This means that, like the rest of Apple's lineup, there's one for everyone!

                <div id="airdescription">
                    If you're considering the iPad Pro, take a look at the <b> 13-Inch Model </b> for the extra screen real estate. The <b> 1 TB </b> of storage will be plenty for all of your files and photos. The decision between the <b> Standard glass </b> and <b> Nano-texture glass </b> is a bit more personal, but I recommend the <b> Nano-texture </b> for people in brighter work environments. If you plan to be on the go, I would recommend <b> Wi-Fi + Cellular </b> and pair that with the <b> Apple Pencil Pro</b> along with the <b> Apple Magic Keyboard </b> to essentially turn this into a MacBook.

            <div id="prodescription">
                The iPad Air is designed for people who want an iPad to take with them everywhere. Opt for the <b> 11-inch </b> model which allows for more portability. <b> 512GB </b> is the best option since portability usually comes with a lot of downloaded content. <b> Wi-Fi + Cellular </b> will maintain the transportability of the device with keeping connected wherever you are. I would suggest the <b> USB-C Apple Pencil </b> for the something to draw with, and <b> no keyboard </b> to keep the price down. However, this may change based on your use case.

                The Mac Studio is the big brother of the Mac mini. Desgined to be the desktop version of the MacBook Pro, this is more of a workhorse.
