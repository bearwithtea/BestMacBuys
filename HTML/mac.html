            Long before the iPhone and the Vision Pro, Apple was a company that made computers and that was about it. They built their empire on top of the Mac and they continue to make fantastic computers for every possible user group. Whether you are someone who needs a machine to scroll Instagram or a movie editor trying to compile 2 hours of 8K footage, the Mac lineup has you covered.

                Apple's all in one solution is the iMac, and it is meant for offices or home offices where people don't need a machine on the go.

                The Mac mini is Apple's lower tier home "desktop." It has no screen, so expect to purchase an external monitor along with a keyboard and mouse. Opt for the <b>8GB of RAM</b> and the <b>256GB of storage</b>. This is the desktop version of the MacBook Air and is designed to not be used to heavily.

                The fact that you are on this website indicates that you probably do not need a Mac Pro. This is the most powerful Mac of all time and is overkill for almost everything you will ever conceive of. For the hell of it, though, opt for the <b>76-Core GPU</b> with <b>192GB of RAM</b>. Combine this with the <b>8TB of storage</b> and you have something that costs as much as a used car.
